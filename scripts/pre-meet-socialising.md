# Pre-meet social

## Hypothesis

1. People will be less anxious and more comfortable going into a political commitment by knowing participants in advance
2. People will be more likely to show up if they have made themselves known to, and socialised with, other participants
3. People who socialise and meet friends through the platform will be more likely to refer others to it

## Metric

- More people who committed to an event will turn up at the event
- Referrals should go up

## Observations

- People naturally sparked up conversation centred around Movement and their activism. Specifically:
    - How they found Movement
    - Why they wanted to get involved
    - Whether they wanted to meet up beforehand
- They also used the group chat as a **handrail**
    - Checking in if they'd be late
    - Confusion over directions and location
    - Confusion over timing
    - Confusion over who to meet / what to do when there
    - Asking for a phone number to call to resolve these queries

## Script
- Hey X, Y. You've both committed to volunteering for Jamming for Change, the Streets Kitchen event, on Sunday from 3.50pm outside Shoreditch High Street Station. It's always nice to have a friendly face in the room so why don't you go ahead and introduce yourselves, and figure out how to recognise each other on the day?
