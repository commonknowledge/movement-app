NOTHING FOUND - PROMPT TO SELF-ORGANISE

Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be anything that matches your interest in ☀️ Climate change + pollution in Hackney at the moment.`

However, we know there are four more people who would like to organise around ☀️ Climate change + pollution in Hackney! You could meet up as soon as tomorrow.

Should we introduce you in a new whatsapp group?

ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE FLY - THESE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THIS OPTION

You can leave at any time if it isn’t for you by leaving the group. Like you, the group will not have done anything like this before.
Thanks so much. We aren’t ready to start introducing people to one another yet. This is a limited version of the final functionality of the _Movement_.
However when we have this ready we’ll let you know right away.

REQUEST FOR INFO: DIDN'T REPLY TO ISSUES

Hi, I'm X, Head of Y at Movement.
(Are you able to talk?)
I'm trying to speak with every user of the service so we can make it better for future users.
We noticed you signed up for the prototype but didn't move forward.
That's absolutely fine.
Would you mind giving us some quick feedback?
We assumed that prompting users with a list of issues on WhatsApp would elicit responses.
What held you back from responding?
(open questioning)
What did you expect to happen next?
Would you consider continuing using the service after this chat?
If not, how might we convince you to return to the service.

STREET RECRUITING

Hiya, do you live nearby?
Do you have 30 seconds to talk about a prototype app for politics?
Great.
It's called Movement.
The aim is to link you up with political campaigns and activists in your local area, so you can do everyday political work as quickly as possible.
(FOR EXAMPLE...)
What I want to do is take you through this 30 second prototype
There are four steps.

1. We'll get a few quick details to help the process along.
2. One of our lovely team will message you on Whatsapp
3. They'll ask you a few quick questions about your political interests, and then match you up with events, campaigns and people.
4. Then the rest is up for you
   Ok...
   (go through app)
   Ok, thanks!
