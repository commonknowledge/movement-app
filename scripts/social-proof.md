# Social Proof

## Hypothesis

Social proof followed by a social commitment (i.e. meet up together, someone else will go if you go) will get people further in the pipeline, hopefully to meet.

Action is collective.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm XXX from the team, here to get you started. We are currently matching YYY users to events, campaigns and groups in Hackney.
- You'll going to pick from a list of issues we will send you in just a moment. Then, if you want, we will add you to a WhatsApp group with other people in Hackney concerned about this issue. This is how all change starts - people wanting into change something, together.
- Are you for it? If not let us know why you wouldn't be.
