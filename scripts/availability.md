# Availability

## Hypothesis

People will be more likely to go to events when we up front ask when they are able to go to events.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

## Script
- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- Tell us one or two times of the week that you can commit to getting involved. We'll match you up with a campaign that meets at that time so you can definitely make it.
- If your up for it then tell us some times you are free. If not let us know why and we can try something else to get you involved. 🙂
