# Availability

## Hypothesis

People will be more likely to go to events when we up front ask when they are able to go to events.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

## Observations

People are often not free on particular weeks, but happy to give a regular evening they are free.

## Script
- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- If you're up for it then tell three times of the week you are free in the next month - something like "Tuesday evenings" or "any Saturday in January".
- We'll match you up with a campaign that meets at that time so you can definitely make it. If that doesn't sound cool let us know why and we can try something else to get you involved. ðŸ™‚

## Legacy - if information on political preferences / location available

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you involved. Two quick questions:
- 1. Where do you work, study, live or hang out in Belfast roughly. E.g. Hackney, central or South London.
- 2. Are you free on either Saturday or Sunday afternoon?

### User isn't available at the alloted times

- Ok, no worries! Tell me three times in the next month you'd be free - something like "Tuesday evenings" or "next Saturday."
- Hey Jenny. Hope you had a great weekend away. Let me know a few times in the month and we can get you involved.
- Something like "Tuesday evenings" or "next Saturday."
