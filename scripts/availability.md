# Availability

## Hypothesis

People will be more likely to go to events when we up front ask when they are able to go to events.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

## Observations

People are often not free on particular weeks, but happy to give a regular evening they are free.

## Script
- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- If you're up for it then tell three times of the week you are free in the next month - something like "Tuesday evenings" or "any Saturday in January".
- We'll match you up with a campaign that meets at that time so you can definitely make it. If that doesn't sound cool let us know why and we can try something else to get you involved. 🙂
