# Coop mode

## Hypothesis

- Having already established a rapport and accompanied each other to an event before, two people will be likely to continue activism if the opportunity presents itself.

## Metrics

- Repeat visits increases in coop mode

## Script

- Hey ***, you both said you were keen to go to another event through Movement.
- So, here are three issues going in the area with events happening soon.
- _Rent is Just Too High_ - East London is bad. In Hackney for example people spent on average 140% of their take home pay on rent.
- _Hackney Council Declares Climate Emergency_ - It was the hottest February on record compared to the coldest last year - that we need to get serious about climate change.
- âœ… _End Homelessness in Hackney_ - Hackney is one of the ten worst areas in the UK for homelessness. _You can go again to Streets Kitchen, but there are other groups too_
- Pick one together and we can keep the ball rolling!

> Get them to pick an issue
> Suggest an event
> Ask if another person could be taken under their wing
> Provide some simple coaching: "think back to your own first event" + here's how you can replicate

- And if you're up for it, we can invite other new users to the chat so you can be their friendly face in the room next time. ðŸ‘‹
