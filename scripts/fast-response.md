### They 'want to get involved'

- Hi ***, welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- Here's what you can do.
- Divest Hackney is a grassroots group campaigning for the council to stop investing millions of pounds in planet wrecking fossil fuel companies.
- They're meeting every Tuesday to build the campaign to make Hackney Council Pension Fund go 100% fossil free. They're really welcoming of new attendees.
- So how do you feel about coming along to their *Open Meeting tomorrow from 19:00-20:30*, at 19 Martello Street, Hackney, E8 3PE

### They said 'maybe'

> send across the stuff anyhow

### They want to 'maximise their impact' - Interview them

Hey ***, so you mentioned you want to maximise your impact as an activist, and you're already a member of some groups. Could you tell me more about where your situation? What kind of activism do you do?

- Before then, you're more than welcome to come to our show and tell on Friday evening, where we'll talk more about Movement and Common Knowledge more generally. https://attending.io/events/commonknowledge?fbclid=IwAR30Pr1u0UIabjcMbavSbY8QrNI7HgABoSEUrluQRtwjhroqm2M-Ix_dFK8
- We've also just started bootstrapping a community forum for UK-wide left tech organising, which we'd love for you to get involved with https://community.movement.chat
- One final ask. You can help our experiments out by referring a few people you know want to get involved in political stuff, but don't know how, to Movement by broadcasting a Whatsapp message through this link: [insert referral broadcast here]
