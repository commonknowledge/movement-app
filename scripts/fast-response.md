### Observation

Users forget their promises and interaction by the time we engage them, reminding them of their promises increases likelihood of commitment. 

We subtly expose their availability.

## Start

### They 'want to get involved'

- Hi ***, welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- Since you said you're available on Saturday and Sunday and you wanted to get involved, here's my best recommendation for you.
CONTEXT - London Renters' Union is a member-led, campaigning union taking action to transform the housing system and win homes for people, not for private profit.
HUMAN ACTION REQUEST - END WITH STRONG 'WHY SHOULD I CARE' - This Saturday, join these housing activists to raise awareness for the campaign to save the Ridley Road street market, a vital community asset threatened by gentrification.
WHERE - They're meeting *Saturday from 1200-1400*, at Dalston Kingsland Overground Station in Hackney. Say whether you're up for it and we'll give you all the details you need to get involved.

SAYING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SEEMS TO ELICIT RESPONSE
REMOVE FROM THE EQUATION THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO - AVOID "ALL THE DETAILS YOU >WILL< NEED TO..."


### They said 'maybe'

> send across the stuff anyhow

### They want to 'maximise their impact' - Interview them

Hey ***, so you mentioned you want to maximise your impact as an activist, and you're already a member of some groups. Could you tell me more about where your situation? What kind of activism do you do?

- Before then, you're more than welcome to come to our show and tell on Friday evening, where we'll talk more about Movement and Common Knowledge more generally. https://attending.io/events/commonknowledge?fbclid=IwAR30Pr1u0UIabjcMbavSbY8QrNI7HgABoSEUrluQRtwjhroqm2M-Ix_dFK8
- We've also just started bootstrapping a community forum for UK-wide left tech organising, which we'd love for you to get involved with https://community.movement.chat
- One final ask. You can help our experiments out by referring a few people you know want to get involved in political stuff, but don't know how, to Movement by broadcasting a Whatsapp message through this link: [insert referral broadcast here]
