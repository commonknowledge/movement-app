### Observation

Users forget their promises and interaction by the time we engage them, reminding them of their promises increases likelihood of commitment. 

We subtly expose their availability.

## Start

### They 'want to get involved'

- Hi ***, welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- Since you said you're available this Saturday and Sunday and you wanted to get involved, here's my best recommendation for you.
> CONTEXT
- London Renters' Union is a member-led, campaigning union taking action to transform the housing system and win homes for people, not for private profit.
> HUMAN ACTION REQUEST - END WITH STRONG 'WHY SHOULD I CARE'
- This Saturday, join these housing activists to raise awareness for the campaign to save the Ridley Road street market, a vital community asset threatened by gentrification.
> WHERE
- They're meeting *Saturday from 1200-1400*, at Dalston Kingsland Overground Station in Hackney. Say whether you're up for it and we'll give you all the details you need to get involved.

> SAYING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SEEMS TO ELICIT RESPONSE
> REMOVE FROM THE EQUATION THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO - AVOID "ALL THE DETAILS YOU >WILL< NEED TO..."


### They said 'maybe'

> send across the stuff anyhow

### They want to 'maximise their impact' - Interview them

Hey ***, so you mentioned you want to maximise your impact as an activist, and you're already a member of some groups. Could you tell me more about where your situation? What kind of activism do you do?

- Before then, you're more than welcome to come to our show and tell on Friday evening, where we'll talk more about Movement and Common Knowledge more generally. https://attending.io/events/commonknowledge?fbclid=IwAR30Pr1u0UIabjcMbavSbY8QrNI7HgABoSEUrluQRtwjhroqm2M-Ix_dFK8
- We've also just started bootstrapping a community forum for UK-wide left tech organising, which we'd love for you to get involved with https://community.movement.chat
- One final ask. You can help our experiments out by referring a few people you know want to get involved in political stuff, but don't know how, to Movement by broadcasting a Whatsapp message through this link: [insert referral broadcast here]
