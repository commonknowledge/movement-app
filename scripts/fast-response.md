## Start

- Hi Greg, welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- Here's what you can do.
- Divest Hackney is a grassroots group campaigning for the council to stop investing millions of pounds in planet wrecking fossil fuel companies.
- They're meeting every Tuesday to build the campaign to make Hackney Council Pension Fund go 100% fossil free. They're really welcoming of new attendees.
- So how do you feel about coming along to their *Open Meeting tomorrow from 19:00-20:30*, at 19 Martello Street, Hackney, E8 3PE
