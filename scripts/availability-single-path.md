# Do Anything, If I'm Free

## Hypothesis

Given that many people will pick all issues, and just want to "get involved", if they state their availability they will not decline an event that fits their schedule.

## Metric

When users are sure they can make an event, the conversion rate (expectation: 100%)

## Observations

## Next Steps

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you involved. Two quick questions:
- 1. Where do you work, study, live or hang out in London roughly. E.g. Hackney, central or South London.
- 2. Are you free on either Saturday or Sunday afternoon?

> Saturday and Sunday are both established events people have already committed to going to.

## Person is available

- Great! Here's what you can do to get involved.
- The London Renters Union Hackney branch’s next public meeting is on Saturday from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm, at Roundchapel, 1D Glenarm Rd, E5 0LY. You can talk about any housing problems you face and learn how we can make London a better place for renters.
- Are you in?

## Person isn't available this weekend / in the area we were looking for

> We go back to the normal [availability script](./availability.md)

- Ok, no worries! Tell me three times in the next month you'd be free - something like "Tuesday evenings" or "next Saturday."
