# Do Anything, If I'm Free

## Hypothesis

Given that many people will pick all issues, and just want to "get involved", if they state their availability they will not decline an event that fits their schedule.

## Metric

When users are sure they can make an event, the conversion rate (expectation: 100%)

##Â Observations

This seems more successful than the pathway than the list of "problem areas" the the [original script](./script.md). People in the "problem areas" tended to give all of them and even supplement them with additional terms, so this was not useful for making a match. It also shows that at this stage our users are interested in helping out with anything.

We get a stronger signal of preference here, which suggests to us the user would be more inclined to go as there is a higher affinity between the user and the group.

##Â Next Steps

We've made the decision to run this script again with another few users and see if we can move things along further.

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you involved.
- Two quick questions:
- 1. Where do you work, study, live or hang out in London roughly. E.g. Hackney, central or South London.
- 2. Are you free on either Saturday or Sunday?

> Saturday and Sunday are both established events people have already committed to going to.
