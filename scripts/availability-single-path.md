# Do Anything, If I'm Free

## Hypothesis

Given that many people will pick all issues, and just want to "get involved", if they state their availability they will not decline an event that fits their schedule.

## Metric

When users are sure they can make an event, the conversion rate (expectation: 100%)

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you involved. Two quick questions:
- 1. Where do you work, study, live or hang out in London roughly. E.g. Hackney, central or South London.
- 2. Are you free on either Saturday or Sunday afternoon?

> Saturday and Sunday are both established events people have already committed to going to.
