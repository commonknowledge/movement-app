# Localised Issues

## Hypothesis

Localising issues will improve progress through the pipeline.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

##Â Observations

This seems more successful than the pathway than the list of "problem areas" the the [original script](./script.md). People in the "problem areas" tended to give all of them and even supplement them with additional terms, so this was not useful for making a match. It also shows that at this stage our users are interested in helping out with anything.

We get a stronger signal of preference here, which suggests to us the user would be more inclined to go as there is a higher affinity between the user and the group.

##Â Next Steps

We've made the decision to run this script again with another few users and see if we can move things along further.

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- What we need to start off is where you work, study, live or hang out in London roughly. For example, you might say Hackney, anywhere in central or South London. We will match you with 3 major issues in that area right now. Then you can say which issue you want to fix and then we will give you all the info you need to get involved!
- Are you up for it? If not let us know and we can try something else to get you involved. ðŸ™‚

## Local Issues To Highlight

- _Rent is Just Too High_ - East London is bad. In Hackney for example people spent on average 140% of their take home pay on rent.
- _Hackney Council Declares Climate Emergency_ - It's the hottest February on record compared to the coldest last year - that we need to get serious about climate change.
- _End Homelessness in Hackney_ - Hackney is one of the ten worst areas in the UK for homelessness.

# Person picked an option

## Person picked an issue with sparse events (e.g. rent)

- Ok, here's what you can do.
- [How the group agrees with your issue] [their political line]
- So how do you feel about coming along to [event and details]. You can [functional and progress jobs done by going to the event].
- [describe the organisers composition]

## Person picked an issue with regular volunteer options

- "Tell me more about the homelessness project?"
    [practical function of relevant group (e.g. Streets Kitchen give out food)]
    [composition and context of group (e.g. volunteers)]
    [political function of group (e.g. Streets Kitchen fulfills the rights of people to eat)]
- The recommendation
    [what are they doing and where â€” event / series of events / the next few events]
    What it involves is [???].
    [Social proof] They are an extremely friendly bunch and we've already matched some people in Movement with them.

### User was interested in volunteering
- Yes, definitely! They're always in need of volunteers.
- On Sunday they'll be giving out warm food and drinks for _Jamming For Change_, outside Shoreditch High Street station. They'll show you what to do and you could even bring an instrument to join in the jam.
- Are you game to meet them at *3.50pm on Sunday* to get involved?
