# Localised Issues

## Hypothesis

Localising issues will improve progress through the pipeline.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

##Â Observations

This seems more successful than the pathway than the list of "problem areas" the the [original script](./script.md). People in the "problem areas" tended to give all of them and even supplement them with additional terms, so this was not useful for making a match. It also shows that at this stage our users are interested in helping out with anything.

We get a stronger signal of preference here, which suggests to us the user would be more inclined to go as there is a higher affinity between the user and the group.

##Â Next Steps

We've made the decision to run this script again with another few users and see if we can move things along further.

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- What we need to start off is where you work, study, live or hang out in London roughly. For example, you might say Hackney, anywhere in central or South London. We we will match you with 3 major issues in that area right now. Then you can say which issue you want to fix and then we will give you all the info you need to get involved!
- Are you up for it? If not let us know and we can try something else to get you involved. ðŸ™‚

## Person wasn't from our Area of Operation (London)

**Hypothesis: by spelling out how committed we are to hooking them up, they will feel a commitment to reflect the efforts, and will not flake**
**Hypothesis: repeating "get involved" will callback to the core job in peoples' heads, and will be more effective than annoying**

- Hey, we're really sorry we've taken so long to reply.
- As you know this is a prototype service and we're currently focused on London.
- But we were excited that people from outside the area were getting involved. Since we're all activists in the office, we figured we'd be able to get in touch with friends in Liverpool who could make recommendations really quickly.
- But it's taking a bit longer than expected! We're really determined to get you involved and learn how we can do this from a distance. We'll get back to you really soon, but meanwhile it'd be really useful to know where you heard about Movement?
