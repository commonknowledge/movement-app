# Localised Issues

## Hypothesis

Localising issues will improve progress through the pipeline.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

##Â Observations

This seems more successful than the pathway than the list of "problem areas" the the [original script](./script.md). People in the "problem areas" tended to give all of them and even supplement them with additional terms, so this was not useful for making a match. It also shows that at this stage our users are interested in helping out with anything.

We get a stronger signal of preference here, which suggests to us the user would be more inclined to go as there is a higher affinity between the user and the group.

##Â Next Steps

We've made the decision to run this script again with another few users and see if we can move things along further.

## Script

- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- In a sec I'm going to send you 3 major issues in Hackney right now. Say which issue you want to fix and then we will give you all the info you need to get involved in fixing it!
- Are you up for it? If not let us know why and we can try something else to get you involved. ðŸ™‚

## Local Issues To Highlight

- _Save Ridley Road Market_ - Ridley Road Market which is used by many in the local community faces closure.
- _End Homelessness in Hackney_ - Hackney is one of the ten worst areas in the UK for homelessness.
- _Win fair pay for Hackney cinema staff_ - Hackney Picturehouse workers are currently striking for a living wage.
