# Localised Issues

## Hypothesis

## Metric

## Local Issues To Highlight

## Script
- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- In a sec I'm going to send you three major issues going on in Hackney right now. At any time you can say you want to get involved with one and then we will link you up with a group campaigning on that issue.
- Are you up for it? If not let us know why and we can try something else to get you involved. ðŸ™‚
