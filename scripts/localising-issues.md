# Localised Issues

## Hypothesis

Localising issues will improve progress through the pipeline.

## Metric

More users get past the issue list and further on in the pipeline.

## Script
- Welcome to Movement! I'm Alex from the team, here to get you started.
- In a sec I'm going to send you 3 major issues in Hackney right now. Say which issue you want to fix and then we will give you all the info you need to get involved in fixing it!
- Are you up for it? If not let us know why and we can try something else to get you involved. 🙂

## Local Issues To Highlight
- *Save Ridley Road Market* - Ridley Road Market which is used by many in the local community faces closure.
