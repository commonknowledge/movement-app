# Pre-recommendation user socialising

## Hypothesis

- People who speak to each other will feel like they are 'getting involved', and the shared social interaction will make them more likely to jointly commit to an event when it is finally recommended. (A form of conditional commitment)
- Users who are put into a chat together will stay active on the service longer than those who cannot find events (that they like, that are near them, etc.) immediately

## Metrics

- Socialising users' duration of activity should be higher than 'isolated users'
- Socialising users' commitment rate should be higher than 'isolated users'

## Script

- Hey ***, hope you had a good weekend.
- So this is a prototype service and we are focused on Hackney, East London right now. But we're excited that people from other parts of the UK are signing up. We're activists ourselves and wanted to develop the prototype so we've committed to getting you involved however we can. It's taking longer than expected, and we're still working on it.
- In the meantime another West Londoner has signed up to _Movement_ and said she's also free on Tuesday evenings, and like you has been to a few meetings in the past.
- So how would you feel about having a chat with her through Whatsapp? Other _Movement_ users gotten on really well, kept each other in the loop before an event, and it's always nice to have a friendly face in the room when you commit to going ðŸ‘‹.

### User invites other user

- Hi ***, *** who's also a Movement user is up for a group chat. Just let me know and I'll introduce you both.
- Also, really appreciate you saying you're happy to do a quick interview. What time of day would be best for me to call? It should take about 30 mins.
