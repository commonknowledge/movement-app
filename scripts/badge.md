# Badges

## Hypothesis

- Being given a personalised, tangible artefact ("something that someone has made for me") that can be shown to other people, will deepen the commitment people initially made.

## Metrics

- Users with badges should be more likely to show up at the events they commit to
- Events with users with badges should be more likely to generate good reviews from organisers, who recognise that the service provides people

## Script

Hey ***, here's your _Movement_ badge for the LAFA event. You can use it to identify yourself to other users of the service you chat with, and it also has some info for the event and an emergency contact. https://commonknowledge.coop/going?cid=...&uid=...
