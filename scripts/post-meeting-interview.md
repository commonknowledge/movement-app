# Post-meet interview

## Hypothesis

1. People who get value out of the platform and are enthusiastic, will be likely to report that by submitting to surveys and interviews

## Metric

- Survey results should go up
- Referrals should go up after taking a survey/interview

## Script

- Hey Barney, thanks very much for going to Streets Kitchen this weekend. As you know this is a prototype service and we're trying to improve it so that as many people as possible can get involved. Do you think you could give us your thoughts through this quick survey? https://movementapp.typeform.com/to/LgnNvp?code=WelcomeðŸ™ŒB45&event=Streets%20Kitchen%20Jamming%20for%20Change
