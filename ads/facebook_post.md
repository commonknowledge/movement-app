Hello, we’re prototyping a new service, it’s called Movement, it helps you find political events and community campaigns in your area.

We’re looking for people to test it out, it’ll only take five minutes.

You might end up helping out at a local food co-op, joining an air quality monitoring group, starting a radical cinema club or spending an evening cooking at a refugee street kitchen. All of these small acts add up to big change.:fist::fire:
